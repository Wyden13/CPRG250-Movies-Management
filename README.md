The goal of this project is to transform business rules into a well-structured database system using Postgres.
This includes designing conceptual, logical, and physical models, implementing the database, and populating it
with sample data, and generating reports

  - Assumptions to clarify missing or ambiguous requirements

**2. Logical Model**
  - Add entities, attributes, PKs, and FKs
  - Connect entities with M:M relationship

**3. Physical Model**
- Define Datatypes and Constraints
- Check Constraints
